                <p>Sometimes the most powerful websites are the ones that don't try too hard.
                   Plain HTML has a certain honesty to it. No frameworks, no build steps,
                   no endless loading spinners. Just content and structure.</p>

                <p>The internet is full of noise. Sometimes the best way to be found
                   is to not be too obvious about it. Let the curious find you.</p>
